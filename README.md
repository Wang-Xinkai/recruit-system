# recruit-system

This is the project for course Software-Engineering.

Backend uses Django framework and fromtend uses vue.js framework.

Now I've finished some functions:
+ fetch data from frontend via http request
+ return data in mysql to frontend
+ query database by the conditions from frontend
+ add basic entities
+ receive json file from frontend

TODO: 
+ use form to receive data 
+ complete other essential functions
+ coordinate with algorithm implementation and frontend
